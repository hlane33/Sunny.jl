G should have dimensions (N_sites, N_times) where N_times matches the 
expected trajectory length in samplebuf.

Like add_sample() in Sunny/CorrelationSampling but uses the quantum new sample
I imagine there is a way to merge quantum_new_sample with new_sample in the Sunny SRC code such that this function 
is redundant, but I didn't want to mess with it for now.
