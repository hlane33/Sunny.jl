# # 4. Generalized spin dynamics of FeI‚ÇÇ at finite *T*

# The [previous FeI‚ÇÇ tutorial](@ref "3. Multi-flavor spin wave simulations of
# FeI‚ÇÇ") used multi-flavor spin wave theory to calculate the dynamical spin
# structure factor. This tutorial performs an analogous calculation at finite
# temperature using the [classical dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent
# states](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.054423).
#
# Compared to spin wave theory, classical spin dynamics in real-space is
# typically much slower and is limited in ``ùê™``-space resolution. The approach,
# however, allows for thermal fluctuations. This allows to explore [finite
# temperature phases](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014427) and enables
# the study of [non-equilibrium
# processes](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.235154).
#
# The structure of this tutorial largely follows the [previous study of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ
# at finite *T*](@ref "2. Landau-Lifshitz dynamics of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ at finite *T*").
# The main difference is that CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ can be well described with `:dipole` mode,
# whereas FeI‚ÇÇ is best modeled using `:SUN` mode, owing to its strong easy-axis
# anisotropy.
#
# Construct the FeI‚ÇÇ system as [previously described](@ref "3. Multi-flavor spin
# wave simulations of FeI‚ÇÇ").
